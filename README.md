# NumberOfRectanglesInASquareGrid
## THERE IS NO CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY
This repository is about a number of different proofs for solving the problem of number of rectangles in a square grid and its variations

I thought about this problem and then I realised that there might be a way to find a mathematical formula which I did using recursion.
Then I googled about this problem and say that it has been solved using Combinatorics (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1656686/how-many-rectangles-can-be-observed-in-the-grid), I didn't really get this proof (I don't have a mathematical background), so I tried working with combinatorics and did it my own way and it differs slightly from the stack overflow answer. My mate also solved this problem using symmeteric matrices. 

This repo will have three different proofs and it will have variations of the problems
- Proof by recursion
- Proof by combinatorics
- Proof by Symmeteric matrices

### (NOTE: By my limited googling, I did not find any website which proves using recursion and Symmeteric matrices)
### Also , if you're looking for the easiest proof to understand, then I would recommend looking at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1656686/how-many-rectangles-can-be-observed-in-the-grid or the proofByCombinatorics document in this repo

I will try my best to explain all proofs to the most basic level

If you find any fault or have anything constructive to provide, then please feel free to talk about it in discussions
